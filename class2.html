      What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
     <strong> typesetting industry.  </strong>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
      text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
      and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        <p>It has survived not only
        five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. </p> 
      
      It was popularised in the <u>1960s</u> with the release of
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
      desktop publishing software like 
        <u>
            <strong>
                <i>Aldus PageMaker</i>
            </strong>
        </u> 
        including versions of
      Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader
      will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
      layout.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
      search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy.
      <p> Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
          accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
